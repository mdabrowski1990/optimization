"""
Evolutionary algorithms.

In this package, you can find following algorithms:
- EvolutionaryAlgorithm - classic Evolutionary algorithm
- SelfAdaptiveEvolutionaryAlgorithm - Evolutionary Algorithm that optimizes both optimized problem and
    optimization process.
Additionally, it is available code for following functions that are part of evolutionary optimization process:
- Selection - functions that selects individuals that would will become parents for new population
- Crossover - functions that mixes attributes of two individuals in order to create two new children
- Mutation - functions that provides mutation to children genes in order to perform search in adjacent areas
