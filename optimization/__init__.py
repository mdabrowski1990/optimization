"""
Package for performing optimization with any of heuristic algorithms.

Current supported list of optimization algorithms:
    - Evolutionary Algorithms
    - Self-adaptive Evolutionary Algorithm (similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, but during optimization process,
        evolutionary algorithm searching method is also optimized)
    - Random Algorithm
